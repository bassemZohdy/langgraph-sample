# NOTICE: Configuration Moved to Root Directory
# =============================================================================
#
# All environment variables have been moved to the root .env file
# Please use the .env file in the project root directory instead of this file.
#
# To get started:
# 1. Copy ../env.example to ../.env
# 2. Modify the values in ../.env as needed
# 3. Run docker-compose from the project root
#
# This approach provides centralized configuration management for all services.
